# Soft Serve

This repository will use [Soft Serve](https://github.com/charmbracelet/soft-serve) by [charmbracelet](https://github.com/charmbracelet/ to provide an easy to navigate TUI available over SSH. 

The git server will only display mirrored repositories and will not be used for repository administration. 

This will be useful to new joiners who can use the server as a starting off point to clone repositories.
